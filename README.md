# experiments_with_ros_pidcontrol_turtlebot 

This repo contains code which implement pid control for turtlebot which is non-holonomic. Alongwith with this I have included a chasing scenrio where one turtlebot chases another turtlebot. In one case the speed of the chasing turtlebot is more than other turtlebot nd in other case its less than the other turtlebot. The last case considers the scenario if the position published by the agent being chased is noisy. I have used a Linear Least sqaures in this scenario.
